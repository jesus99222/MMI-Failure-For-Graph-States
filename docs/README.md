# Entropy Vector Library

Open `index.html` in this directory to explore all eight-qubit graph-state families included in the dataset. Each table folder (for example `minimalStarNonTFailSvecs/`) contains:

- `index.html` — cards for every representative in the family with thumbnail previews.
- `<label>.html` — the full entropy vector for a specific graph, a copy-to-clipboard button, and links back to the global index.
- Thumbnails are shared via `../images/` and referenced by each page with relative paths.

The HTML is static and self-contained.
